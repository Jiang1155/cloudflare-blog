mmdist - Efficient Euclidean distance in high dimensional spaces
======

Finding a nearest neighbour in a high-dimiensialty spaces is
hard. Here, we have a 144-dimension uint8 coordinates, and a very
large number of points in the space.

This project contains various brute-force algorithm implementations,
each building on the previous one, geared towards solving the nearest
neightbour problem.

To run:

```
